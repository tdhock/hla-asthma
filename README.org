** TODOs

- nonlinear models like SVM, KNN, ctree, cforest.
- augmented feature space (age, SNPs)

[[file:figure-test-error.R]] produces two plots:

Facetted roc curves (one for each test fold) suggest that
glmnet.balanced model (not glmnet.one) is better than random guessing.

The error metrics below show that the glmnet.balanced model is
definitely learning a weak pattern that can predict asthma/healthy
status better than random guessing (which is what major.class and
glmnet.one do).

probabilities from test.RData.
