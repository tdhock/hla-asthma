** TODOs

- clinical data for other 14 diseases. setup cross-validation
  experiment with folds that contain 10% of each disease?
- multi-task learning code? Is it more or less accurate than the
  disease-specific single-task learning model? Are the sets of
  selected genes different?
- survival prediction (coxnet or AFT?)
- nonlinear models like SVM, KNN, ctree, cforest.
- augmented feature space (age, SNPs)
- unscaled model so we can interpret weights.

Meeting with Steve, explained L1-regularized logistic regression
model. QUESTION: what is the common mechanism of the 15 different
diseases?

[[file:figure-glmnet.R]] produces a plot which shows glmnet model
selection curves: binomial deviance on the validation set, and AUC on
the train/test sets.

[[file:figure-glmnet.R]] produces a plot of variable importance in terms
of number of folds for which each variable was selected in 10-fold CV.

[[file:figure-test-error.R]] produces two plots:

Facetted roc curves (one for each test fold) suggest that
glmnet.balanced model (not glmnet.one) is better than random guessing.

The error metrics below show that the glmnet.balanced model is
definitely learning a weak pattern that can predict asthma/healthy
status better than random guessing (which is what major.class and
glmnet.one do).
