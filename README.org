** TODOs

- multi-task learning code? Is it more or less accurate than the
  disease-specific single-task learning model? Are the sets of
  selected genes different?
  - glmnet type.multinomial="grouped" 
  - Julien's spams code apparently does this.
- survival prediction (coxnet or AFT?)
- nonlinear models like SVM, KNN, ctree, cforest.
- augmented feature space (age, SNPs)

- [[file:figure-test-error/index.html][Interactive data viz of test error]].
- unscaled model so we can interpret weights.

- problem with inconsistent asthma status solved, but what does it
  mean to have a negative age at onset? I guess a value of 0 means
  that the person was born with the disease, but what do ages of -1
  and -3 mean?

** 31 Mar 2016

- read clinical data for many other diseases in
  [[file:all.autoimmune.R]].
- [[file:fold.R]] now uses simple random sampling.

** 22 Mar 2016

New [[file:input.features.R]] [[file:output.diseases.R]] and [[file:models.R]]
which can be used to define different input feature representations,
different output diseases, and different predictive models.

Meeting with Steve, explained L1-regularized logistic regression
model. QUESTION: what is the common mechanism of the 15 different
diseases?

[[file:figure-glmnet.R]] produces a plot which shows glmnet model
selection curves: binomial deviance on the validation set, and AUC on
the train/test sets.

[[file:figure-glmnet.R]] produces a plot of variable importance in terms
of number of folds for which each variable was selected in 10-fold CV.

[[file:figure-test-error.R]] produces two plots:

Facetted roc curves (one for each test fold) suggest that
glmnet.balanced model (not glmnet.one) is better than random guessing.

[[file:figure-test-error-roc.png]]

The error metrics below show that the glmnet.balanced model is
definitely learning a weak pattern that can predict asthma/healthy
status better than random guessing (which is what major.class and
glmnet.one do).

probabilities from test.RData.
